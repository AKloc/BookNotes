## The Unicorn Project (May 2020)
- What am I hoping to get out of reading this?
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Basically a story about how an experienced engineering manager moves to a disorganized mess of a department, starts instituting changes and getting others on board and making progress, and how that elevates the entire company.
- Covers the basics pretty nicely. This is probably a really good primer for DevOps / Agile practices for someone who isn't familiar with them at all. It feels like something is missing in terms of telling the reader that some of the main characters' actions have more formal names - e.g., "THIS IS CALLED CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION, BTW."
- Very, **very** corny / cheesy at times. The entire "Rebellion" whereby a group of employees who don't like their jobs get together outside of work for hours at a time to discuss work and have stickers on their machines is pure /r/thathappened material. The evil manager who has a change of heart at the end of the book. How easily the hero and the Rebellion in general are able to recruit people into caring more. Etc.
- All of the stuff about working crazy hours for long stretches is awful and shouldn't be promoted or idealized. I don't think the author was going too over the top with this, but I personally hate that message, especially since the main character is missing tons of time with her family. 

**What can I do with this?**
- Recommend it to others who don't know anything about DevOps?

**Bottom Line**
- 6/10, but that's mostly based on my familiarity with the underlying DevOps themes and the corniness of some of the material. 
- Not a fan, at all, of how the book somewhat romanticizes the idea of working tons of hours and being invasive of work / life balance.
