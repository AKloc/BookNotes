## The Unicorn Project
- What am I hoping to get out of reading this?
 
**Main Takeaways**
- What are the major themes / points made?

**What can I do with this?**
- Recommend it to others who don't know anything about DevOps?

**Bottom Line**
- 6.5/10, but that's mostly based on my familiarity with the underlying DevOps themes and the corniness of some of the material. 
- Not a fan, at all, of how the book somewhat romanticizes the idea
