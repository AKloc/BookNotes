## The Unicorn Project
- What am I hoping to get out of reading this?
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Basically a story about how an experienced engineering manager moves to a disorganized mess of a department, starts instituting changes and getting others on board and making progress, and everyone

**What can I do with this?**
- Recommend it to others who don't know anything about DevOps?

**Bottom Line**
- 6/10, but that's mostly based on my familiarity with the underlying DevOps themes and the corniness of some of the material. 
- Not a fan, at all, of how the book somewhat romanticizes the idea of working tons of hours and being invasive of work / life balance.
