## Speed Reading (August 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I hope to pick up strategies that will help me read more quickly without sacrificing comprehension.

**Main Takeaways**
- Have a legitimate purpose before reading a book. What is it I want to get out of this? Use that to determine how careful to read.
- IN GENERAL: It's all in the eyes and using more out of your peripheral vision.
	- STRATEGY 1: Focus on spaces instead of individual words.
	- STRATEGY 2: Focus on chunks 6-7 words apart. This seems to work well for me. For each line, start about 20% of the way in, then jump to 80%, then go to the next line.
	- Make sure you're not "reading aloud" in your head. It slows you way down.
	- Don't stop. Keep going. The brain will generally catch up.
	- It's OK to slow down depending on content.
- Advanced speed:
	- All about increasing periphery even more - ideally, you'd look down the middle of the page and just move your eyes vertically rather than side to side. 
	- Do eye exercises (there are five listed)
- Increasing comprehension:
	- Don't daydream.
	- Visualize the content in your head.
	- Occasionally ask yourself to sum up in your head what you just read - this helps the brain to retain info.


**What can I do with this?**
- I'm adding a field for "Purpose of reading" in my template notes.
- I believe the chunking strategy actually works really for me

**Bottom Line**
