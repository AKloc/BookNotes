## Algorithms of Oppression (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Given all of the recent events in America, I've wanted to explore more on the topics of racism and how I can generally be more informed and active in the cause for equality. I believe this book was listed under the Liazon reading club's master list of books and it caught my eye as something that I'd like to know more about.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- There was a time when Googling "black girls" basically only turned up porn - at what point does Google have a responsibility for promoting racist concepts?
- This is a thorough academic look at Google's search results, particularly as they relate to black women.
- "It's just an algorithm!" can't be an excuse, especially when Google has demonstrated the capability to tweak search results.
- Research has been done that demonstrates that the types of search results a person gets back from a search can effect how they actually feel about the topic - so how does searching "black girls" and getting nothing but porn back affect searchers?
- Google has private, profit-based motives. Where's the public option?
- 

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Bottom Line**
- x/10
- Very academic. Slowly and methodically builds its case... too slowly. 
- Well-organized. Author quickly states her thesis and her strategy for proving it. Principled. Author calls out that her arguments aren't unique to black women by any stretch of the imagination.
- BUT... where's the meat? Makes the same points numerous times. Search results are important, Google isn't working for the public interest, and the algorithms Google use aren't tuned for socio-economic equalization. What else? What are the solutions?
