## Algorithms of Oppression (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Given all of the recent events in America, I've wanted to explore more on the topics of racism and how I can generally be more informed and active in the cause for equality. I believe this book was listed under the Liazon reading club's master list of books and it caught my eye as something that I'd like to know more about.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- There was a time when Googling "black girls" basically only turned up porn - at what point does Google have a responsibility for promoting racist concepts?
- This is a thorough academic look at Google's search results, particularly as they relate to black women.
- "It's just an algorithm!" can't be an excuse, especially when Google has demonstrated the capability to tweak search results.
- Research has been done that demonstrates that the types of search results a person gets back from a search can effect how they actually feel about the topic - so how does searching "black girls" and getting nothing but porn 

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Bottom Line**
