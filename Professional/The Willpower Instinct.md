## The Willpower Instinct

**Purpose For Reading**
- Always looking for tools against procrastination and improving self-control, particularly since I'm starting a new job.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Willpower is three powers:
	- I will 
	- I won't (this is hard)
	- I want
- You have two selves. Present and future. Push is almost always for the present because of biology.
- Willpower is like a tank. You can refill it with rest, meditation, going for a walk / exercising.
- Willpower can be increased by exercising it regularly, like a muscle. 
- Dopamine isn't about reward, it's about the PROMISE of reward. It doesn't always pan out. Advertisers look for how to trigger that.
	- Hack dopamine by rewarding yourself by doing things you put off.
	- Be mindful when you satisfy a dopamine urge, like eating a snack you know you shouldn't - did it really make you feel better? Keep noting those things.
- If / when you slip up, forgive yourself. Guilt makes you weaker. Punishment doesn't help.

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?
