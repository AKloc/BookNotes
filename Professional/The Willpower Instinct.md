## The Willpower Instinct

**Purpose For Reading**
- Always looking for tools against procrastination and improving self-control, particularly since I'm starting a new job.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Willpower is three powers:
	- I will 
	- I won't (this is hard)
	- I want
- You have two selves. Present and future. Push is almost always for the present because of biology.
- Willpower is like a tank. You can refill it with rest, meditation, going for a walk / exercising.
- Willpower can be increased by exercising it regularly, like a muscle. 
- Dopamine isn't about reward, it's about the PROMISE of reward. It doesn't always pan out. Advertisers look for how to trigger that.
	- Hack dopamine by rewarding yourself by doing things you put off.
	- Be mindful when you satisfy a dopamine urge, like eating a snack you know you shouldn't - did it really make you feel better? Keep noting those things.
- If / when you slip up, forgive yourself. Guilt makes you weaker. Punishment doesn't help.
- Tempted?
	- Wait ten minutes.
	- Think about what you're doing as a deliberate choice to give up on the best possible long-term goal (like getting thinner).
	- Think about how proud you've felt in the past for beating these urges in the past.
- Self-control is contagious. Get more people invested in what you're doing. Increase your accountability.
- Spend a little time in the morning thinking about today's goals.
- Trying to suppress thoughts / emotions / cravings is HARMFUL and often backfires. Much like anxiety attacks, you should acknowledge and observe these feelings without acting on them, if possible. Don't ignore or pretend they don't exist.

**What can I do with this?**
- Some good tactics around resisting temptations.
- Good reinforcement around the concept of letting cravings "wash over you"

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 6/10
- Was ironically a slog to get through. Already knew most of the strategies. Simple concepts that didn't need three different examples each to hammer home.
- The breakdowns at the end of the chapter were great, though.
