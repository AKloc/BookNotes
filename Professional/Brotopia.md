## Brotopia (December 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Diversity is a major issue in the industry. I want to raise my awareness of the history, the issues, and what sorts of things I might be able to do to help.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Really nice Silicon Valley history overall.
- The Paypal Mafia - Thiel, Musk, etc. 
	- Big believers in meritocracy. The best should get the gig, period. 
	- Does this work if the game is rigged against groups of people from the outset?
- Interesting startup balance considerations between "We need to have to people who already think the way we do so we can move fast" and "We need to make sure that we're diverse from the start otherwise under-represented groups won't join us later."
- A lot of awful stories, in general, about Silicon valley.
	- Doing business / having lunches at strip clubs.
	- Sex parties where business was commonly discussed. If women attend, they get a reputation that follows them. If they don't attend, they're deemed prude.
	- Day one sexual harassment. "I'm in an open relationship with my wife, she can find men, but I can't find women. How about it?"
	- UNDERLYING THEME: These attitudes are baked into the culture of these organizations when they're male-dominated.
- Reddit, 4chan, etc suffer from the same types of things. Story about how Reddit cofounders were raised on the internet, thought insane racist subreddits and whatnot were generally "fine" because of their own perspectives.
- Encouraging colleagues to stay at work at all hours is problematic for parents and women. Buying dinner for everyone to encourage that is cheesy.

**What can I do with this?**
- Another reason not to do whiteboarding interviews: some women literally are assuming they're being "checked out" when it's happening. Very alienating.
- ASK: "Can you refer people to me that look like you?" There's a difference between looking for diverse candidates and discriminating against two candidates on the basis of gender / race.
- SEEK DIVERSITY. Not as an HR checkbox, but as an opportunity to improve products, the way you work, everything.
- Set diversity-based goals. Wait for candidates.
- Get rid of the ping pong table. "WORK HARD, GO HOME" ethos from Slack.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 9/10
- Got lost in this book. Really well-written, very convincing.
- Another effective empathy lens.
- Like that a good amount of time is spent on the "why this is important for businesses" and actual potential solutions are recommended.
