## Better Allies

**Purpose For Reading**
- I'm hoping for some reasonable goals / actions I can take to help under-represented groups while avoiding pitfalls I might not be aware of.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- No one is the perfect ally, everyone is on a journey. This isn't about earning a badge or saying you're a definitively great human.
- You will screw up, and your ideas of what being a good ally are will probably change over time, and that's OK.
- Privilege:
	- A set of unearned benefits bestowed on a group. Not a bad thing, just means someone with privilege has less obstacles than person without.
	- Often invisible to those who have it.
	- Point of knowing you have privilege is so that you're aware of it and can be empathetic to those who might be less privileged. 
- Roles an ally can play:
	- Sponsor: helping individuals gain credibility and exposure by vocally supporting their work, recommending them for promotions and stretch assignments, etc.
	- Champion: Same as sponsor, but more publicly / visibly. e.g., directing questions toward "the expert", advocating for individuals to do talks, etc.
	- Amplifier: Works to make sure marginalized voices are heard. e.g., "I'd like to go back to what x was saying," creating a meeting code of conduct, inviting individuals to speak at staff meetings.
	- Advocate: Works to bring marginalized individuals into highly exclusive circles.
	- Scholar: learns as much as possible about underrepresented groups and their challenges. Listens, asks, learns.
	- The upstander: The opposite of a bystander. Calls out and combats wrongdoing.
	- The confidant: Creates safe spaces for underrepresented groups so they can express fears, frustrations, and needs.
- "The best allies are willing to make mistakes and KEEP TRYING."
	- You will never be a perfect ally. Consider it a challenge to be a better one.
- Knights: Basically white knights. They want to make marginalized groups damsels in distress. Virtue signaling, basically. Ask yourself...
	- What am I trying to accomplish by doing / saying this?
	- How many people is this going to help?
	- If I do this, is it going to matter a year from now?
- Asking / talking about unconscious bias:
	- Open by acknowledging fears. "I'm worried I'm going to put my foot in my mouth..."
	- Be open and respectful. Acknowledge anything said. Listen.
	- DON'T GET DEFENSIVE. You're not debating, you're here to listen and learn.
		- "Pushing back against statements about one's own privilege is one of the quickest ways to shut down communication."
	- Embrace your inner bias. We ALL have our unconscious biases. That's human. It's fine to admit it.
	- Focus on actions.
- Red flag language to watch out for:
	- "Not a culture fit" -> But is it a culture ADD? (LOVE THIS)
	- "I don't want to lower the bar."
	- "I want to see them prove they can handle the responsibility before giving it to them."
	- "Can you take notes / order the food / clean up?"
- How do you confront discrimination / inappropriate behavior?
	- Verbalize what you saw. "Did you just say x?" "I think what I just heard is y."
	- Bring up prior behavior. "I've always thought you were a fair-minded person, so I'm surprised to hear you say that"
	- Set boundaries. "Don't say racist stuff around me."
	- DO NOT just call someone a racist / misogynist / etc. That will immediately just shut them down.
- 
- "Everyday Language" chapter has tons of things I could improve on.
	- Use "they", even when referring to an individual.
	- "Ladies" isn't necessarily great.
	- "Guys" -> "Everyone", "folks", "crew"
	- "Ladies and gentlemen" -> "Distinguished guests"
	- "lame" -> "subpar", "mediocre," "disappointing"
	- "powwow" -> "meeting," "check-in", "talk"
	- "spirit animal" -> "patronus"
	- Technical jargon:
		- "master / slave" -> "primary / replica"
		- "whitelist / blacklist" -> "safelist / blocklist"
- There's an interesting dynamic I wish the book got into - how do I ask someone from an under-represented group how I can improve as a white male?
- On hiring / job descriptions:
	- Be cognizant of the pictures you're using.
	- Highlight paternal / family leave benefits
	- Don't use alpha-ish language like "high-powered" / "competitive" / "results-drive" / "action-oriented" 
	- DO include "ability to work on a diverse team with a diverse range of people"
	- LIMIT TO FIVE REQUIREMENTS, AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS. 
		- Remember the studies that show that women tended to apply for jobs only when they felt like they had 100% of requirements met!
		- Cut "nice to have" requirements. 
		- Don't make postings intimidating!
	- Place postings in multiple areas. e.g., LinkedIn is 95% male applicants.
	- Ask employees to recommend people from under-represented groups, and offer referral bonuses.
- Don't shy away from giving critical feedback to underrepresented groups. Radical candor!

**What can I do with this?**
- Write a plugin for chat / email / etc that looks for bad terms (like the above) and offers replacements?
- Try to stop using offensive everyday bad language.
- Up my game in promoting and hiring under-represented groups.
- Sponsor more.
- "I'd like to hear more about x's thought" when interrupted.

**Personal Bottom Line**
