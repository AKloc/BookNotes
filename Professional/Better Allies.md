## Better Allies

**Purpose For Reading**
- I'm hoping for some reasonable goals / actions I can take to help under-represented groups while avoiding pitfalls I might not be aware of.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- "Everyday Language" chapter has tons of things I could improve on.
	- Use "they", even when referring to an individual.
	- "Ladies" isn't necessarily great.
	- "Guys" -> "Everyone", "folks", "crew"
	- "Ladies and gentlemen" -> "Distinguished guests"
	- "lame" -> "subpar", "mediocre," "disappointing"
	- "powwow" -> "meeting," "check-in", "talk"
	- "spirit animal" -> "patronus"
	- Technical jargon:
		- "master / slave" -> "primary / replica"
		- "whitelist / blacklist" -> "safelist / blocklist"
- There's an interesting dynamic I wish the book got into - how do I ask someone from an under-represented group how I can get better? Is it potentially offensive to 

**What can I do with this?**
- Write a plugin for chat / email / etc that looks for bad terms (like the above) and offers replacements?
- Try to stop using offensive everyday bad language.
- Up my game in promoting and hiring under-represented groups.
- Sponsor more.
- "I'd like to hear more about x's thought" when interrupted.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
