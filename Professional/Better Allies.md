## Better Allies

**Purpose For Reading**
- I'm hoping for some reasonable goals / actions I can take to help under-represented groups while avoiding pitfalls I might not be aware of.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- No one is the perfect ally, everyone is on a journey. This isn't about earning a badge or saying you're a definitively great human.
- You will screw up, and your ideas of what being a good ally are will probably change over time, and that's OK.
- Privilege:
	- A set of unearned benefits bestowed on a group. Not a bad thing, just means someone with privilege has less obstacles than person without.
	- Often invisible to those who have it.
	- Point of knowing you have privilege is so that you're aware of it and can be empathetic to those who might be less privileged. 
- Roles an ally can play:
	- Sponsor: helping individuals gain credibility and exposure by vocally supporting their work, recommending them for promotions and stretch assignments, etc.
	- Champion: Same as sponsor, but more publicly / visibly. e.g., directing questions toward "the expert", advocating for individuals to do talks, etc.
	- Amplifier: Works to make sure marginalized voices are heard. e.g., "I'd like to go back to what x was saying," creating a meeting code of conduct, inviting individuals to speak at staff meetings.
	- Advocate: Works to bring marginalized individuals into highly exclusive circles.
	- Scholar: learns as
- "Everyday Language" chapter has tons of things I could improve on.
	- Use "they", even when referring to an individual.
	- "Ladies" isn't necessarily great.
	- "Guys" -> "Everyone", "folks", "crew"
	- "Ladies and gentlemen" -> "Distinguished guests"
	- "lame" -> "subpar", "mediocre," "disappointing"
	- "powwow" -> "meeting," "check-in", "talk"
	- "spirit animal" -> "patronus"
	- Technical jargon:
		- "master / slave" -> "primary / replica"
		- "whitelist / blacklist" -> "safelist / blocklist"
- There's an interesting dynamic I wish the book got into - how do I ask someone from an under-represented group how I can improve as a white male?

**What can I do with this?**
- Write a plugin for chat / email / etc that looks for bad terms (like the above) and offers replacements?
- Try to stop using offensive everyday bad language.
- Up my game in promoting and hiring under-represented groups.
- Sponsor more.
- "I'd like to hear more about x's thought" when interrupted.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
