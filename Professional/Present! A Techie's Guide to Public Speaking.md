## Present! A Techie's Guide to Public Speaking

**Purpose For Reading**
- Starting a new management job soon. Haven't had to do a presentation in a while. Looking at this book as a potential way to help shake some of the rust off and learn some new tricks. Karen Catlin also wrote "Better Allies," which I enjoyed.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- What are the major themes / points made?

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 7.5/10
- Good reinforcement around stuff 
- Really quick read despite being 260 pages in length. Chapter summaries are great. Chapters themselves are short.
- Would've liked to see more around stage fright.
- A lot of really good information on giving general talks - I was looking for more about doing better presentations within a company, but it covered all of that material and went a little further.
