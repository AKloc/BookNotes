## Present! A Techie's Guide to Public Speaking

**Purpose For Reading**
- Starting a new management job soon. Haven't had to do a presentation in a while. Looking at this book as a potential way to help shake some of the rust off and learn some new tricks. Karen Catlin also wrote "Better Allies," which I enjoyed.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Talks should be conversational. Imagine you're chatting with someone in the audience, that should be the tone.
- Talk about real-life experience.
- INVENTORY METHOD
	- Used to find experiences and expertise you can share.
- Think about your audience and focus on what they're looking for.
	- Audience persona? Motivation? Experience level? What takeaways should they have? What questions will they have?
- Stories are huge.
	- Help the audience empathize with a problem.
	- They're relatable, because they're real.
	- They make abstract ideas concrete.
	- Are memorable and repeatable.
- Humor: Only make fun of yourself. No one else.
- Structuring stories: Use arcs.
	- Context
	- Challenge
	- Available solutions
	- Final takeaways
- Before putting a talk together, put a proposal together first, send it out, see if there's interest. Basically an outline of the talk with summary, takeaways, format, audience, your bio.
- CREATE AN OUTLINE.
	- This is NOT a script. Similar to what I already do today.
	- Introduction
	- Motivation
	- Takeaways
	- Conclusion
- Talk through your outline multiple times until you hit the time you're shooting for and delivery is smooth.
	- Practice by yourself.
	- Then in front of a camera.
	- Then in front of one person.
	- Then in front of a small audience.
- Stage Fright: Difference between being nervous and having true fear. Pre-talk nerves impact EVERYONE.
	- Strike a power pose for a few minutes.
	- Interlock fingers and pull apart.
	- Meet and greet audience before you go onstage to make some "friends"
	- PRACTICE
	- Identify and name specific anxieties. This is a version of acknowledging anxiety rather than suppressing it. Anticipate it and ACCEPT it.
- Delivery: Experiment with style. Factors:
	- Body language
	- Eye contact (10-20 seconds, if in a big arena, look 2/3s up the middle of the audience)
	- Gestures (holding up numbers, etc)
	- Walking (can be used to show progress through your talk)
	- Vocal inflections
- Slides: Create only AFTER you've developed your talk.
	- You don't ever want to be dependent on your slides.
	- Limit to 2-3 words per slide, 4-5 words per bullet point, 5 bullets per slide.
- Q&A:
	- Anticipate questions in advance.
	- "I don't know" is OK, and it's also OK to ask if anyone in the audience knows the answer.
	- "Take it offline" strategy
- Before you present:
	- Make sure the tech works.
	- Have a copy of your presentation on your laptop, on the cloud, on a drive, in both your presentation format as well as PDF format.
	- Check out the stage. What's your walking plan?
	- Plan out your time. Arrive an hour early, test tech, leave 20 minutes to chat with attendees?

**What can I do with this?**
- I should do a lightning talk at CodeMash.
- Like the angle that for any sort of conversation that's going to take any time, to not lean on slides. Tell stories. Even if they're for work meetings.
- Have some good checklist items in these notes.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 7.5/10
- Good reinforcement around stuff the power of telling stories, and keeping things conversational
- Really quick read despite being 260 pages in length. Chapter summaries are great. Chapters themselves are short.
- Would've liked to see more around stage fright.
- A lot of really good information on giving general talks - I was looking for more about doing better presentations within a company, but it covered all of that material and went a little further.
