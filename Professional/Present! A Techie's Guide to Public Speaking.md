## Present! A Techie's Guide to Public Speaking

**Purpose For Reading**
- Starting a new management job soon. Haven't had to do a presentation in a while. Looking at this book as a potential way to help shake some of the rust off and learn some new tricks. Karen Catlin also wrote "Better Allies," which I enjoyed.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Talks should be conversational. Imagine you're chatting with someone in the audience, that should be the tone.
- Talk about real-life experience.
- INVENTORY METHOD
	- Used to find experiences and expertise you can share.
- Think about your audience and focus on what they're looking for.
	- Audience persona? Motivation? Experience level? What takeaways should they have? What questions will they have?
- Stories are huge.
	- Help the audience empathize with a problem.
	- They're relatable, because they're real.
	- They make abstract ideas concrete.
	- Are memorable and repeatable.
- Humor: Only make fun of yourself. No one else.
- Structuring stories: Use arcs.
	- Context
	- Challenge
	- Available solutions
	- Final takeaways
- Before putting a talk together, put a proposal together first, send it out, see if there's interest. Basically an outline of the talk with summary, takeaways, format, audience, your bio.
- CREATE AN OUTLINE.
	- This is NOT a script. Similar to what I already do today.
	- Introduction
	- Motivation
	- Takeaways
	- Conclusion
- Talk through your outline multiple times until you hit the time you're shooting for and delivery is smooth.
	- Practice by yourself.
	- Then in front of a camera.
	- Then in front of one person.
	- Then in front of a small audience.
- Stage Fright: Difference between being nervous and having true fear. Pre-talk nerves impact EVERYONE.
	- Strike a power pose for a few minutes.
	- Interlock fingers and pull apart.
	- Meet and greet audience before you go onstage to make some "friends"
	- PRACTICE
	- Identify and name specific anxieties. This is a version of acknowledging anxiety rather than suppressing it. Anticipate it and ACCEPT it.

	- Experimen

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 7.5/10
- Good reinforcement around stuff the power of telling stories, and keeping things conversational
- Really quick read despite being 260 pages in length. Chapter summaries are great. Chapters themselves are short.
- Would've liked to see more around stage fright.
- A lot of really good information on giving general talks - I was looking for more about doing better presentations within a company, but it covered all of that material and went a little further.
