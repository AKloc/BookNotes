## Alice & Bob Learn Application Security

**Purpose For Reading**
- From the Liazon Book Club
- Haven't read a security-centered book in a few years at least, good time for a refresher.
- Probably add some good stuff to my cheat sheet project.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Security boils down to CIA:
	- Confidentiality (my data isn't visible)
	- Integrity (data is current, correct, accurate)
	- Availability

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
