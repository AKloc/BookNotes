**Purpose For Reading**
- Highly rated, was in the book club, always looking for design perspective.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Two goals:
	- Describe what complexity is and why it matters
	- Present techniques to reduce it.
- Complexity = anything that makes code hard to understand or change.
	- "If you write a piece of code and it's simple to you but complex to others, it's complex."
	- Complexity causes "Change amplification," which means you have to change code in many different places often.
	- Complexit
- Basically, the most important thing you can do is shoot for a clean design.
- Much more important for code to be READABLE than easily writable.
