## Flawless Consulting

**Purpose For Reading**
- I'm working on a pitch at work based on creating a consultancy. Hoping to glean some information to tighten up the plan. I'm assuming a lot is going to be somewhat redundant so will be mostly skimming this.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Interesting concept that there's an inherent weird relationship between consultants and managers because the managers are essentially admitting that they don't have a competency that the consultant does, or that they need some sort of help.
- 

**What can I do with this?**
- Use the concept of having a general "contract" in place that states what the crew is doing, how often they'll have stakeholder communications, etc.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
