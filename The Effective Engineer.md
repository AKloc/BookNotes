## The Effective Engineer

**Main Takeaways:**
- Very solid book for a new engineer. Probably the best I've ever read fo
- The book causes ROI "leverage" and uses that as the main driver for deciding what to work on.
- Big focus on prioritization and general investments.
- Props for mentioning that he did stints at big companies without harping on that too much (*cough* Radical Candor)
- Good organization overall, starting with mindset, then going to short and long-term thinking.
