## The Effective Engineer

**Main Takeaways:**
- Very solid book for a new engineer. Probably the best I've ever read in this category that isn't focused on coding.
- The book calls ROI "leverage" and uses that as the main driver for deciding what to work on, keeping it in mind when you're considering doing something that's a PITA now but could save hundreds of total hours later, etc. Really good thing for engineers to keep in mind.
- Big focus on prioritization and how what you invest in your time in matters down the road.
- Big on metrics.
- Props for mentioning that he did stints at big companies without harping on that too much (*cough* Radical Candor).
- Really nice organization overall, starting with mindset, then going to short and long-term thinking.
- Probably not as much of a book for veterans.


**Future Value**
- Use in training for new engineers?

**Bottom Line**
- 9/10. The book lives up to its title.
