**Purpose For Reading**
- Diversity is a major issue in the industry. I want to raise my awareness of the history, the issues, and what sorts of things I might be able to do to help.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Really nice Silicon Valley history overall.
- The Paypal Mafia - Thiel, Musk, etc. 
	- Big believers in meritocracy. The best should get the gig, period. 
	- Does this work if the game is rigged against groups of people from the outset?
- Interesting startup balance considerations between "We need to have to people who already think the way we do so we can move fast" and "We need to make sure that we're diverse from the start otherwise under-represented groups won't join us later."
- A lot of awful stories, in general, about Silicon valley.
	- Doing business / having lunches at strip clubs.
	- Sex parties where business was commonly discussed. If women attend, they get a reputation that follows them. If they don't attend, they're deemed prude.
	- Day one sexual harassment. "I'm in an open relationship with my wife, she can find men, but I can't find women. How about it?"
	- UNDERLYING THEME: These attitudes are baked into the culture of these organizations when they're male-dominated.
- Reddit, 4chan, etc suffer from the same types of things. Story about how Reddit cofounders were raised on the internet, thought insane racist subreddits and whatnot were generally "fine" because of their own perspectives.

**What can I do with this?**
- Another reason not to No whiteboarding interviews. Even past the obvious unrealistic setting, it sets up a weird power dynamic. Some women literally are assuming they're being checked out when it's happening. Very alienating.

**Personal Bottom Line**
