## Brotopia

**Purpose For Reading**
- Diversity is a major issue in the industry. I want to raise my awareness of the history, the issues, and what sorts of things I might be able to do to help.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Really nice Silicon Valley history overall.
- The Paypal Mafia - Thiel, Musk, etc. 
	- Big believers in meritocracy. The best should get the gig, period. 
	- Does this work if the game is rigged against groups of people from the outset?
- Interesting startup balance considerations between "We need to have to people who already think the way we do so we can move fast" and "We need to make sure that we're diverse from the start otherwise under-represented groups won't join us later."

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
