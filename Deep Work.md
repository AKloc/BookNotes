## Deep Work (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I already understand the general concept of flow and getting rid of distractions. I really enjoyed "Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport, the same author of this book, particularly because it had a lot of very pragmatic strategies that I've adopted. I'm hoping to pick up on similar strategies here.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- "Shallow": Easy, repeatable, anyone can do it. Ex: checking email. Opening Facebook. Searching the internet. Manually tooling around in spreadsheets for hours at a time.
- "Deep": Requires sustained concentration. Ex: writing a novel. Putting complex automation behind those same spreadsheets.
- Thrust of the book is that today's work environment is full of shallow distractions / shallow work

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Bottom Line**
- x/10
