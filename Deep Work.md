## Deep Work (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I already understand the general concept of flow and getting rid of distractions. I really enjoyed "Digital Minimalism" by Cal Newport, the same author of this book, particularly because it had a lot of very pragmatic strategies that I've adopted. I'm hoping to pick up on similar strategies here.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- "Shallow": Easy, repeatable, anyone can do it. Ex: checking email. Opening Facebook. Searching the internet. Manually tooling around in spreadsheets for hours at a time.
- "Deep": Requires sustained concentration. Ex: writing a novel. Putting complex automation behind those same spreadsheets.
- Thrust of the book is that today's work environment is full of shallow distractions / shallow work while, at the same time, deep work is becoming increasingly valuable. Understanding this can give you a huge competitive edge and more importantly, help live a more fulfilling life.
- Strategies:
	- "Monastic": Good if you're doing one big, solo effort after another, like writing a book or coding a big ugly piece of software. You're optimizing for deep work as often as you possibly can and avoiding shallow work wherever possible.
	- "Bimodal": You turn it on and off for periods of time. Example given: Carl Jung going to his retreat in the woods when he had to write papers, but coming back and fielding all sorts of shallow work again.
	- "Rhythmic": You have established patterns which become easy to follow. e.g., coming into work early, when no one else is around, and diving deep into work daily. Another example: Seinfeld writing a joke every day and crossing off his calendar when he does write a joke, with the goal being to not break the chain.
	- "Journalistic": Turn it on and off at a whim. Author cited going on vacation with a guy who could just run off for a few hours and immediately go into deep work and then return.
- Keep in mind: Deep work requires recharging. If you want to use it consistently, you also need to take some off time and guard it (e.g., don't check work email at night)
- Learning how to work deeply is a muscle that you can make stronger with exercise.
	- Validation! "Grand gestures" like going to a different location and spending some money 


**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Bottom Line**
- x/10
- A little repetitive. I was sold early on the concept that in order to do next-level work that you have to concentrate and be generally free from distractions - didn't need another 50 pages on it.
