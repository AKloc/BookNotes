## Chaos Engineering (October 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I'm familiar with the concept and Chaos Monkey, just looking to take a deeper dive. Ideally, get some action items from this that I can apply at work.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- Chaos Engineering is basically about creating a CULTURE of experimentation with complex systems, not just running random tests.
- Chapter 9 has a good series of questions to ask before and after exercises

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?
- C

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 6.5/10
- Pages 20-100 are basically just different accounts of the same general philosophy. Seemed like filler since none of it was particularly controversial or requiring lots of convincing.
