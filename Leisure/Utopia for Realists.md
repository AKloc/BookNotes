## Utopia for Realists (Feb 2021)

**Purpose For Reading**
- General enjoyment and agreement of some of the concepts like reduced work hours. Interested in reading some more of the backing info, since it might be something I can pitch in the future at work.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- The author is the same guy who told Tucker Carlson that he's a tool on his show.
- GDP is ridiculous because it's used as a measuring stick of progress, but it's predicated on the idea that the only thing that matters is how much stuff people are buying. Doesn't take any sort of general happiness into account. Doesn't value volunteer work. Doesn't take general improvements / cost reductions into account.
- 40 hour work weeks aren't effective. Most people are browsing Facebook by the end of every day. Even Richard Nixon was pushing the concept of reduced work weeks for a while, but we stalled.
- Too many "bullshit jobs," leading to further unhappiness. People get that they're not doing a lot of meaningful work and don't like it, either.
- The best way to reduce poverty is literally to give poor people money. Actual studies show that those people will use the money to help themselves, not drugs / booze / whatever.
	- Same with homelessness. Give them a home.
- Borders are a crazy concept when you think about it. Enforcing them wasn't even a thing until WW2. Today they're used to segment haves from have-nots, limit incomes, etc. If borders were lifted general wealth of the world would skyrocket.
- Idea with shorter work weeks isn't to let people be lazy and do nothing, which they ultimately don't like - it's to let them do the things that matter to them. e.g., woodworking, volunteering, etc.
- Problem with the political left is that they want to treat symptoms rather than causes, and don't have strong enough convictions. Has lead to erosion and rise of the right.
- Don't feel like a sucker for being an idealist. Women's voting, abolishment of slavery, etc were once thought of as extreme ideal ideas.

**What can I do with this?**
- I'd love to pitch the idea of offering reduced-hour

**Personal Bottom Line**
