## Utopia for Realists

**Purpose For Reading**
- General enjoyment and agreement of some of the concepts like reduced work hours. Interested in reading some more of the backing info, since it might be something I can pitch in the future at work.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- The author is the same guy who told Tucker Carlson that he's a tool on his show.
- GDP is ridiculous because it's used as a measuring stick of progress, but it's predicated on the idea that the only thing that matters is how much stuff people are buying. Doesn't take any sort of general happiness into account. Doesn't value volunteer work. Doesn't take general improvements / cost reduction

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
