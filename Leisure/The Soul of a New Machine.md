## The Soul of a New Machine (October 2020 - stopped on page 30)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Another highly recommended book on computer history.
- Pulitzer Prize winner.
- A lighter read after "Bringing Columbia Home".
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- What are the major themes / points made?

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
- DNF - wasn't particularly engaging, especially knowing that the companies being written about no longer exist and were never big enough to be a name that I'd recognize. Might revisit.
