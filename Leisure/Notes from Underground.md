## Notes From Underground

**Purpose For Reading**
- A literary classic, cover art looked cool.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- 120 pages of a self-imporant 19th century neckbeard ranting about how he's so mad that he can't function.
- Why doesn't he just fire his servant?

**What can I do with this?**
- Not much, though I understand where this might have been deemed as revolutionary because of how unrelentingly "negative" it was in its day.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 3/10
- Author did a great job conveying the aimless thought process of the subject, but... so what?
