## Feeding the Mouth that Bites You (October 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Looking for some background and a strategy around growing adolescents and how we can help them as well as ourselves as parents.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- We live in weird times - kids don't have to grow up and start working immediately when they turn 10 like they did pre-industrial revolution. We have more time in general.
- Teenaged years = "adults in training."
	- Main source of frustration for adolescents is that their parents are micromanaging them.
	- Teens are "trying on" different personalities, likes, styles... everything. It's part of the process. Expect it.
- Main mission for parents in teenage years is to give their kids increased autonomy so that when they're "adults" (loosely, graduating high school), they understand responsibility.
- CHILDREN: Need obedience.
- ADOLESCENTS: Need responsibility.
- "Planned emancipation": a deliberate and transparent plan that gives more responsibility to your kids that you completely let go of. 
	- ex: "Your room is now your responsibility, we won't make you clean it. Limits - it can't smell, and you can't have food upstairs."
	- As you give kids more responsibilities / trust, you tell them so they get that they ARE being emancipated.
	- "Giving freedom does not mean that you will no longer have influence in that area."
- Helpful terms to use a lot:
	- "At your age, you're old enough to do x by yourself without my intervention". Not used in a condescending / scolding way, but in a "I trust you here" manner.
- "Only through good communication can you hope to remain relevant and have any influence in your children's lives as they pass into adulthood."
	- Don't lecture.
	- Be a passive listener. If your kid tells you about another kid being a jerk, don't say the kid is a jerk, ask how the kid feels about it.
	- Techniques: Dad dates. Car conversations (nice because it guarantees an end to the conversation and that attention is at least somewhat split)
- Need to really respect privacy. 

**What can I do with this?**
- empathy++.
- 

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 9/10
- Based just on the notes I wrote above, I think it's evident I got a lot out of the book.
- Really nice mix of general and specific strategies.
- Appreciate that the book wasn't condescending towards teens.
- Author clearly had a bit of a religious slant, but it didn't interfere with the core content
