## Feeding the Mouth that Bites You (October 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Looking for some background and a strategy around growing adolescents and how we can help them as well as ourselves as parents.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- We live in weird times - kids don't have to grow up and start working immediately when they turn 10
- Teenaged years = "adults in training."
- Main mission for parents in teenage years is to give their kids increased autonomy so that when they're "adults" (loosely, graduating high school), they understand responsibility.

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
