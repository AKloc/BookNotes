## The Righteous Mind - Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Leading up to what's going to be a tumultuous 2020 election, it seemed to be a good way to try to increase empathy and understanding with the people I don't agree with and avoid dehumanization. 
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Most people start with a judgement immediately, and then rationalize afterward.
- More than anything, we're concerned with how other people think about us.
- "Conscious reasoning is like a press secretary whose sole job is to justify the actions of the president."
- Our inner press secretaries are VERY good at their jobs at convincing ourselves that we're on the right side (and entities like Google, which will always show you something that agrees with something you want to establish confirmation bias in, make it that much easier)
- Five foundations:
	- Care / Harm
	- Fairness / Cheating
	- Loyalty / Betrayal
	- Authority / Subversion
	- Sanctity / Degradation
- Left cares primarily about Care and Fairness, but the right cares about all five.
- Each one of those foundations is like a taste on the tongue - and the more tastes you can appeal to, generally the better.
- Group cohesion is important. Right has an edge because of religion. Left discounts this.

**What can I do with this?**
- The "five foundations" concept will probably be a lens that I'll try to actively use both when consuming (reading about politics) and producing (if I'm doing a presentation that has any controversial topics / plans, it could help to try to appeal to as many foundations as possible subtly).

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 5/10
- This is written pretty academically. I was hoping for a lit more actual political talk, but large portions of the book are spent on topics like evolution, philosophy, and psychology stuff. It isn't a horrible thing because clearly it all factors in, but rather than just touching on the topics and plugging them into the larger thesis, we get a history of competing theories, dive into detail of experiments that probably wasn't really necessary, etc. I would've preferred a somewhat tighter focus.
- Returning to this a few days after I finished reading it and having read some Amazon reviews - it's pretty bloated. The author's take on liberals only being concerned with two foundations doesn't really seem like it was well-proven. Also
