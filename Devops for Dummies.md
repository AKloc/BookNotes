## DevOps For Dummies (December 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Book club pick, has come up before in conversations of good books.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- DevOps is way bigger than CI/CD.
- SDLC = "Software DELIVERY Life Cycle". Like that idea.
- Be DELIBERATE about culture. Don't let it be run by inertia.
- Values:
	- Encourage teamwork
	- Reduce silos
	- Practice systems thinking (everything impacts everything)
	- Embrace failure
	- Communicate
	- Accept feedback
	- Automate processes when appropriate
- "Values are meaningless if you don't incentivize the behavior that lives up to them."
	- Idea prizes
	- Hack time
	- Fun off-sites

**What can I do with this?**
- I have to use "inertia" more.
- Why do we not have a "How was your experience" box when users finish enrollment?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
- Really well-written, good pacing.
- Content is definitely broader than what I thought would be, but not in a bad way. Good insights with some of the culture stuff and how it all ties together.
