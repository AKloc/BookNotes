## DevOps For Dummies (December 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Book club pick, has come up before in conversations of good books.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- DevOps is way bigger than CI/CD.
- SDLC = "Software DELIVERY Life Cycle". Like that idea.
- 

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
- Really well-written, good pacing.
- Content is definitely broader than what I thought would be, but not in a bad way. Good insights with some of the culture stuff and how it all ties together.
