## How to be an Antiracist (June 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I naively believed that systemic racism was not as large of an issue as current events have made apparent and wanted to get a modern understanding of racism and how I can be more of an ally.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- "Not being a racist" is a copout. You either support policies that support racism or you're against them.
- Individual acts can be racist or antiracist, and no one is perfect.
- School taxes, standa

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Bottom Line**
- x/10
