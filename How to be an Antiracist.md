## How to be an Antiracist (June 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I naively believed that systemic racism was not as large of an issue as current events have made apparent and wanted to get a modern understanding of racism and how I can be more of an ally.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- "Not being a racist" is a copout. You either support policies that support racism or you're against them.
	- "The opposite of 'racist' isn't 'not racist.'"
- Individual acts can be racist or antiracist, and no one is perfect.
- School taxes, standardized tests where you can pay for classes that teach how to take the test more effectively are generally suspect.
- Race isn't really "real" - black isn't a race. Yet we fixate on it.
- On things like affirmative action - "the defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equality or inequality."
- "I don't see color" is the biggest bullshit that ever was.

**What can I do with this?**
- This book firmed up a lot of nebulous concepts I had in my head.

**Bottom Line**
