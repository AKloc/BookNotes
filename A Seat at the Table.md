## A Seat at the Table (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- This was recommended by the Liazon book club. The book's subject is about technology leadership / management, which is where I operate 40 hours a week. It would be nice to glean some fresh insights.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Getting a seat at the table ~= getting to CIO 
- Questions being tackled:
	- If autonomous teams / DevOps / agile basically handle the vast majority of product and engineering management, how do tech leaders fit in?
- The role of management isn't to place constraints on teams, it's to help set the conditions for success.
- Waterfall is stupid. Funny insight here about how IT loves when scope creep occurs because it's the ultimate excuse to blow out dates, which locks "the business" into requirements even when they become useless.
- Agile is generally good, or at the very least, it's a lot more realistic.
- "Requirements" are stupid. Required for what? The business to live or die? Desired outcomes are better.
- When starting a new initiative, as a leader, understand:
	- What are the business outcomes the team is striving for?
	- How will the team determine what to work on?
	- How is the team going to work together / communicate? Skillsets?
	- How will the team get feedback on their work?
	- What are the key risks to delivery?
	- What can I do to help the team accomplish it's goals?
- When a team isn't exposed directly to outcomes, it fixates on requirements, which are often wrong.
- Author advocates for an approach where the business says "This is what we want to happen" and then the team is tasked with creatively figuring out and implementing how.
- Executive's job:
	- Creatively define strategic parameters
	- Align the organization to them
	- Boldly implement them.
	- Observe with feedback cycles and pivot where necessary.
- Agile goal on work: Do the LEAST amount of work possible to hit the objective. No fluff.
- Not really a lot of other crazy notes to take here. This book is sort of a high-level manual about how to be a CIO that

**What can I do with this?**
- I'm warming up to the concept of tasking teams with desired outcomes rather than the solutions.
- Good book to recommend to higher-ups who are interested in what Agile can do.

**Bottom Line**
- x/10
- Pretty nice overview of modern development practices from the perception of an executive.
