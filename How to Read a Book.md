## How to Read a Book

**Main Takeaways** 
- Don't skip the table of contents. It's like having a roadmap ahead of you and lets you know the structure of what you're reading before you really start.
- For educational / learning stuff, it's OK to cheat and skim the end of chapters since that's where authors do a lot of their summations.
- Speed reading isn't really important, what's important is to understand that having different speeds for different kinds of books is an important tool. BUT - things that slow us down include...
	- How the eye "jumps" a few times across each line of text vs. scanning smoothly across a line
	- Going back and re-reading too often. It's OK to not completely "get" something sometimes.
	- Book recommended pointing with index, middle, and thumb to scan across lines
- Don't understand something? Keep reading, straight through, and then try reading the book again afterward when you have more context.
- It gets WORDY at some points. I spent 20 minutes reading about the concept that sometimes words mean different things in different contexts.
- Getting further into the book, it only got worse. 20 pages dedicated to the concept that authors will make important points and then try to back them up with evidence. Who is this for?
- I threw the towel in about halfway through the book and skimming the remainder. This isn't a practical guide, it's a philosophical interpretation of what books are, the relationship of an author and a reader, etc.
- The ultimate "level" of reading is a made-up term, "syntopic reading." Despite the book being 350 pages, it only spends 25 of them on the topic, which boils down to "It's when you read multiple books on the same topic, and by the way, if you want to learn more, we have another book on the topic..."

**What can I do with this?**
- I'm going to start reading the Table of Contents.
- Skim books that I don't have Amazon reviews for to get an idea re: what they're about.
- I'll work on re-reading a book rather than read it once and spending time re-reading individual passages. It's a false  constraint.

**Bottom Line**
- 3/10, emphasizing that that reflects my personal attitude toward the book and not a universal judgement on it. I couldn't finish it. To be fair, and probably much to the book's joy, I probably could have determined that this was a philosophical book instead of a practical one. Even philosophically, it wasn't particularly interesting. Yes, a
