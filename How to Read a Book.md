## How to Read a Book

**Main Takeaways**
- Don't skip the table of contents. It's like having a roadmap ahead of you and lets you know the structure of what you're reading before you really start.
- For educational / learning stuff, it's OK to cheat and skim the end of chapters since that's where authors do a lot of their summations.
- Speed reading isn't really important, what's important is to understand that having different speeds for different kinds of books is an important tool. BUT - things that slow us down include...
	- How the eye "jumps" a few times across each line of text vs. scanning smoothly across a line
	- Going back and re-reading too often. It's OK to not completely "get" something sometimes.
- Don't understand something? Keep reading, straight through, and then try reading the book again afterward when you have more context.


**What can I do with this?**
- Read the Table of Contents.
- Skim books that I don't have Amazon reviews for to get an idea re: what they're about.
- Prefer to re-read a book rather than read it once

**Bottom Line**
- 9/10. The book lives up to its title.
