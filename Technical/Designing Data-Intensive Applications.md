## Designing Data-Intensive Applications
___
### Chapter 1 - Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
- There are a lot of different databases that are suited for different kinds of applications. We have to figure out what the best ones are for the job.
- Lots of datastores now and it can be difficult to categorize them.
- Many applications use multiple data stores to meet processing and storage needs.
- When designing a data storage system, some questions:
	- How do you ensure the data is correct and complete?
	- How do you provide good performance to clients?
	- How do you scale?
- THREE MAIN CONCERNS when designing software:
	- **Reliability**: continuing to work correctly, even when things go wrong.
		- Faults: when a single component deviates from spec.
		- Failure: when the whole system stops providing the required service.
		- It's better to tolerate faults than prevent them.
	- Scalability
	- Maintainability
