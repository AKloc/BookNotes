## Bringing Columbia Home (Oct 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I went down the Challenger / Columbia rabbit hole lately, wanted to read more.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- I definitely like Titanic-like stories about technological hubris gone wrong.
- Didn't know about a (suspected) piece of the leading wing that was caught on radar before burning up in the atmosphere. Crazy.
- The story about the watch that was to be gifted to one of the astronaut's exs, who was a major player in the recovery and rebuilding effort, was also crazy.
- How did the searchers find so many pieces that were a quarter in size???
- 25000 people and 500

**What can I do with this?**
- I want to visit the KSC more now and visit the Columbia's front window pane.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 8.5/10
- Detailed, informative, engaging.
- Nice mix of human and technical writing.
