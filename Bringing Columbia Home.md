## Bringing Columbia Home (Oct 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I went down the Challenger / Columbia rabbit hole lately, wanted to read more.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- I definitely like Titanic-like stories about technological hubris gone wrong.
- Didn't know about a (suspected) piece of the leading wing that was caught on radar before burning up in the atmosphere. Crazy.

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
