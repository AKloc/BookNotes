## Bringing Columbia Home (Oct 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- I went down the Challenger / Columbia rabbit hole lately, wanted to read more.
 
**Main Takeaways & Metacognition**
- I definitely like Titanic-like stories about technological hubris gone wrong.
- Didn't know about a (suspected) piece of the leading wing that was caught on radar before burning up in the atmosphere. Crazy.

**What can I do with this?**
- I want to visit the KSC more now and visit the Columbia's front window pane.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 8.5/10
- Detailed, informative, engaging.
- Nice mix of human and technical writing.
