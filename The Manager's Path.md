## The Manager's Path

**Main Takeaways**
- 1:1s that don't suck are hugely important. 
- Understanding the actual value in the work you're doing is important.
- If you want to be promoted or to become a manager or get into leadership, it's on you to actually manage and lead that.
- The Peter Principle, and not climbing the ladder just for the sake of it
- Being the alpha geek isn't a good thing, and being super-technical but not understanding the rest of the business or even the local team environment is still often more harmful than it is good
- Management is ACTIVE. If you're just keeping the lights on, you're probably not a great boss.
- Rock stars vs. superstars
- Senior engineers are much more than technical expertise.

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?
