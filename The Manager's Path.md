## The Manager's Path

**Main Takeaways**
- 1:1s that don't suck are hugely important. 
- Understanding the actual value in the work you're doing is important.
- If you want to be promoted or to become a manager or get into leadership, it's on you to actually manage and lead that.
- The Peter Principle, and not climbing the ladder just for the sake of it
- Being the alpha geek isn't a good thing, and being super-technical but not understanding the rest of the business or even the local team environment is still often more harmful than it is good
- Management is ACTIVE. If you're just keeping the lights on, you're probably not a great boss. Open-door policy is a feel-good idea, but you have to be active in asking for and giving feedback.
- Rock stars vs. superstars
- Senior engineers are much more than technical expertise.
- Process isn't the enemy, but you have to keep up with it, be agile, change as conditions do, etc.
- Self-advocacy is everything.
- Be deliberate about what management styles you use at different times and with different individuals. Some people NEED to be micromanaged to some degree, but that has to be a temporary thing.
- Don't ask for information you can't get yourself.
- Positive feedback is important and will make colleagues more likely to listen to you when there's coaching.
- NO SURPRISES ALLOWED. If you give someone a nasty review and they're taken aback by it, you've probably failed them.
- Change the environment sometimes. Happy hours, lunches, etc are really helpful in building bonds that carry over into work.
- Don't be nice. Be kind.
- Much of management is shielding your people where possible, without over-sheltering. e.g. - business shifting priorities 100 times. Make the decision to NOT complain to your team as the leader.
- Managers have to stay technical. Go out of your way to do it. But have to stay technical. Don't be the middle manager who's just passing information through.

**What can I do with this?**
- We used the concepts from this book to draw up our leveling criteria.
- Great reminder about how important meaningful 1:1s are, and to bring items to meetings.
