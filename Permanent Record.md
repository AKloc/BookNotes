## Permanent Record (September 2020)
**Purpose For Reading**
- More in the column of leisure read. I'm familiar with Snowden's general story, but was interested in hearing it in more detail, particularly if there was anything interesting in the technical realm.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Basically, the concept of privacy is basically evaporating. Everyone's dirty laundry is somewhere.
- Really liked Snowden's take on how the founders' take was clearly to make finding someone guilty of something HARD, because if it's too easy, everyone's guilty of something.
- Also related to the bit about how in the early days of the internet, we had the latitude to make mistakes, be foolish, troll, etc, and it wasn't permanent. It didn't follow us around. Every time you logged on it was basically a fresh chance.

**What can I do with this?**
- I might try to use Tor more for day-to-day activities
- I may also need to 

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
