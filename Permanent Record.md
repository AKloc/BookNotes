## Permanent Record (September 2020)
**Purpose For Reading**
- More in the column of leisure read. I'm familiar with Snowden's general story, but was interested in hearing it in more detail, particularly if there was anything interesting in the technical realm.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Basically, the concept of privacy is basically evaporating. Everyone's dirty laundry is somewhere.
- Really liked Snowden's take on how the founders' take was clearly to make finding someone guilty of something HARD, because if it's too easy, everyone's guilty of something.
- Also related to the bit 

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
