## Weapons of Math Destruction

**Main Takeaways**
- Data science is all about creating models to represent solutions, but you have to be pretty careful about what you're trying to test for. Examples:
	- Creating a model for rating colleges but not including prices leads to insanely overpriced colleges, because the colleges optimize for every other factor EXCEPT price.
	- Police using ML to predict where they should be patrolling based on previous crimes, which leads to more confirmed crimes in those areas, which leads to the model placing more weight in those areas, etc... this sounds fine at first, but what if the same thing was done in affluent neighborhoods? Traffic laws, white collar crimes, etc...
	- Employment screening systems that were setup to help recruiters in the 80s, learned a model that basically threw out any resumes that didn't have "American" names
	- Political campaigning that can be super-targeted to individuals; e.g., 

**What can I do with this?**
- Be super careful about what any sort of data models, surveys, etc are optimizing for.
