## Weapons of Math Destruction

**Main Takeaways**
- Data science is all about creating models to represent solutions, but you have to be pretty careful about what you're trying to test for.
	- Examples: Creating a model for rating colleges but not including prices leads to insanely overpriced colleges, because the colleges optimize for every other factor EXCEPT price.

**What can I do with this?**
- Be super careful about what any sort of data models, surveys, etc are optimizing for.

**Bottom Line**
