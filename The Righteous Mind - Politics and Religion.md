## The Righteous Mind - Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- Leading up to what's going to be a tumultuous 2020 election, it seemed to be a good way to try to increase empathy and understanding with the people I don't agree with and avoid dehumanization. 
 
**Main Takeaways**
- Most people start with a judgement immediately, and then rationalize afterward.
- More than anything, we're concerned with how other people think about us.
- "Conscious reasoning is like a press secretary whose sole job is to justify the actions of the president."
- Our inner press secretaries are VERY good at their jobs at convincing ourselves that we're on the right side (and entities like Google, which will always show you something that agrees with something you want to establish confirmation bias in, make it that much easier)

**What can I do with this?**
- What actions am I going to take based on this book, if any?

**Personal Bottom Line**
- x/10
