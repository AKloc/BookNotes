- Empathy is a major theme - similar feel to it that Radical Candor's "give a damn" point.
- "Life Alienating Communication"
	- Comparisons."How to Make yourself Miserable": Compare yourself to other people. Take a picture of yourself and compare it to celebrities. Humorous, but main point is that comparisons stink.
	- Denying responsibility for garbage reasons - e.g., nazis saying "We were following orders", "I dink because I'm an alcoholic", "I had to cook dinner because I'm the wife"
