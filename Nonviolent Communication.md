## Nonviolent Communication (August 2020)

**Main Takeaways**
- Empathy is a major theme - similar feel to it that Radical Candor's "give a damn" point.
- "Life Alienating Communication" that you want to generally avoid:
	- Comparisons."How to Make yourself Miserable": Compare yourself to other people. Take a picture of yourself and compare it to celebrities. Humorous, but main point is that comparisons stink.
	- Denying responsibility for garbage reasons - e.g., nazis saying "We were following orders", "I dink because I'm an alcoholic", "I had to cook dinner because I'm the wife"
	- "It's in everyone's interest that people change, not to avoid punishment, but to better themselves."
- FIRST COMPONENT OF NVC:  separate *observations* from *evaluations,* and use observations more. They're real things that actually happened and not judgements.
	- "That guy is an idiot because I saw him do something stupid" is an evaluation. "That guy just locked his keys in his car" is an observation.
	- "You never do what I want" is an evaluation. "The last three times I pitched something you said no" is an observation.
- SECOND COMPONENT OF NVC: Express how we're feeling.
	- Doesn't mean "let everything out," but there's a way to express emotion that can help ensure that what you're saying isn't interpreted as criticism / aggression.
	- There's a difference between what we FEEL and what we THINK we are.
	- e.g.: "I feel inadequate as a guitar player" isn't really what we're feeling. "I feel disappointed in myself as a guitar player" is. "Inadequate" isn't a feeling. Frustrated / disappointed / frustrated is.
	- Watch out for words like ignored / disrupted / rejected / unwanted / pressured. They're not OUR feelings, they're words that we use to INTERPRET others.

**What can I do with this?**
- I really like the idea of using "I feel disappointed / angry that you did x because y" more with my kids to explain why what I'm telling them to do is ultimately important.
- Using observations instead of evaluations could probably help out in a lot of my personal conversations.

**Bottom Line**
- 7.5/10
- The general themes are great - empathizing and letting people know that you're empathizing, truly, is very powerful. Have to avoid judging.
- Some of the quoted exchanges seem a little overblown
