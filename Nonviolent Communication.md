## Nonviolent Communication

**Main Takeaways**
- Empathy is a major theme - similar feel to it that Radical Candor's "give a damn" point.
- "Life Alienating Communication"
	- Comparisons."How to Make yourself Miserable": Compare yourself to other people. Take a picture of yourself and compare it to celebrities. Humorous, but main point is that comparisons stink.
	- Denying responsibility for garbage reasons - e.g., nazis saying "We were following orders", "I dink because I'm an alcoholic", "I had to cook dinner because I'm the wife"
	- "It's in everyone's interest that people change, not to avoid punishment, but to better themselves."
- VERY important to separate *observations* from *evaluations*.
	- "That guy is an idiot because I saw him do something stupid."
	- "You never do what I want."

**What can I do with this?**
- I really like the idea of using "because" more with my kids to explain why what I'm telling them to do is ultimately important.
