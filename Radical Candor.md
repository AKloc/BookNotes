## Radical Candor (Q4 of 2019)
**Purpose For Reading**
- Very popular book that was highly recommended in conversations around technology management 
  
**Main Takeaways**
- Crystallization of some relatively obvious ideas, but there's a lot of value in them being crystallized. Examples:
	- The quadrants
	- The concept that giving tough feedback is truly a form of empathy
	- "Tough love" is a very legit thing if not abused.
- You need to ASK for and take feedback whenever you can.

**What can I do with this?**
- When I read the book, I was relatively taken with it and pushed for a seminar with the rest of the management group here.
- Made this a mandatory reading for all of my managers
- Some of the concepts in the book directly fed into our leveling criteria for managers.
- Very helpful reference point when I know I should have a tough conversation. Grounds me in coming from a place of empathy.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 9.5/10. Content is great, may get repetitive at times. The name-dropping gets a little old, but it's not distracting at all.
