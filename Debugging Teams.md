## Debugging Teams (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- This is a commonly cited book worth reading for management. Diego highly recommended it.
- It's short. 150 pages.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- There pillars are "HRT", pronounced like "heart":
	- Humility
	- Trust
	- Respect
- "Projects always outlast people." Playing the social "game" isn't a bad idea.
- Be open to being influenced, or you'll become the person everyone navigates around / avoids.
- On politics: Think of having a bank. You have to be cognizant of your balance!
	- Deposits: Delivering / launching stuff.
	- Withdraws: Working on tech work, refactoring, etc.
- Emailing executives - they generally get off on being able to help, and will do so by delegating to one of their subordinates. Send a three bullet point note and what you want.
- Employee Happiness =
	- Autonomy
	- Mastery
	- Purpose
- Risks need to be taken, and sometimes it's OK to ask for forgiveness.
	- "If you're not missing at least one flight a year, you're getting to the airport too early."
- 

**What can I do with this?**
- This is a pretty solid book for new managers. Not as directly practical as "The Manager's Path."
- Check that; this is a good read for anyone working on a team. Maybe recommend it to the department? Add it to the reading list?
- I really like how the book crystalized some of the political concepts.

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 8/10
- Favorite part was the political stuff. Nothing really new there, but the "keep a balance" concept is helpful. I'd love to read a longer book on that subject using that concept.
- The brevity and pacing was great. No fluff.
- Points docked would be "personal" points due to me already having a good understanding of large swaths of the book.
