## Debugging Teams (September 2020)

**Purpose For Reading**
- This is a commonly cited book worth reading for management. Diego highly recommended it.
- It's short. 150 pages.
 
**Main Takeaways**
- There pillars are "HRT", pronounced like "heart":
	- Humility
	- Trust
	- Respect
- "Projects always outlast people." Playing the social "game" isn't a bad idea.
- Be open to being influenced, or you'll become the person everyone navigates around / avoids.
- 

**What can I do with this?**
- This is a pretty solid book for new managers. Not as directly practical as "The Manager's Path."
- Check that; this is a good read for anyone working on a team. Maybe recommend it to the department? Add it to the reading list?
- I really like how the book crystalized some of the political concepts. 

**Personal Bottom Line**
- 8/10
