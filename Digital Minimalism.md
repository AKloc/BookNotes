## Digital Minimalism

**Main Takeaways**
- There's an ROI with all of our digital lives. Seek to optimize.
- Too much online stuff is isolating and depressing.

**What can I do with this?**
- I like the angle of being really deliberate about ROI of online stuff.
- I deleted Instagram from my phone because I can both catch up with it when I'm on a PC and FB is notorious for tracking mobile users more than I'm comfortable with. Two birds with one stone.

**Bottom Line**
- x/10
