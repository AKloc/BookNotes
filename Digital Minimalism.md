## Digital Minimalism (August 2020)

**Main Takeaways**
- There's an ROI with all of our digital lives. Seek to optimize.
- Too much online stuff is isolating and depressing. Don't be obsessed with getting Facebook likes. Don't fall into the trap of losing massive amounts of time because there are small benefits with platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
- Amish aren't luddites; they're DELIBERATE in which technologies they use and don't use. e.g. - cars aren't allowed because it eats away from families spending time together, visiting the sick in the community, etc.
- DECLUTTER STEPS:
	- STEP 1: Define your technology rules
		- Try to get away from completely optional stuff
		- It's OK to set qualifiers for some things ("Operating Procedures") - e.g., I'll only access Instagram from a PC
	- STEP 2: Take a 30 day break
		- Don't just stop using certain tech, fill the newly-freed time up with good stuff like reading books, making career investments, etc
	- STEP 3: Reintroduce technology
		- Deliberately. Be picky about what you allow back.
		- "How do I maximize the benefits and minimize the harm?"

**What can I do with this?**
- I like the angle of being really deliberate about ROI of online stuff.
- Going forward - be intentional and deliberate when signing up for any sort of social media / news / digital life stuff.
	- What do I want to get out of this?
	- How much time do I want to spend on it on an ongoing basis?
	- How do I know if it's "working?" How do I evaluate that and make changes?
- I deleted Instagram from my phone because I can both catch up with it when I'm on a PC and FB is notorious for tracking mobile users more than I'm comfortable with. Two birds with one stone.
- I installed an app that tracks how often I unlock my phone and how much time I spend in apps.
- I'm seriously considering deleting Reddit from my phone.
- SHOULD: Find a hobby that's "physical" and spend time on it.
- SHOULD: Create a house to-do list that I can burn through that would lend itself to some of those "feeling accomplished" days.

**Bottom Line**
- 9.5/10
- Very eloquent, very readable, pacing is great, doesn't slog.
- General observation, or maybe confirmation bias - it's funny how many of these types of books are based on ROI.
